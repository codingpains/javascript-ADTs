# How to contribute

Hi, thanks for contributing to Crafty!  We've got guidlines on 

- [How to build Crafty](https://github.com/craftyjs/Crafty/wiki/Building)
- [What workflow to use](https://github.com/craftyjs/Crafty/wiki/Workflow)

## Quick summary

- You'll need node, npm, and grunt-cli (installed globally) to work with Crafty's dev tools
- With those already installed, `npm install` from Crafty's directory will setup everything else you need
- Once you've made any changes, then `grunt check` will build and test your new version of Crafty.
